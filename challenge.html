            <h1>introduction</h1> 
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What you should already know</h1>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
             </section>
        <section id="hello"> 
            <h1 id="Hello_world">Hello world</h1>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                      }
                      greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
                    </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <h1 id="Variables">Variables</h1> 
            <p> You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase)</p>
            <p> You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section"> 
            <h1 id="Declaring_variables">Declaring variables</h1>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <h1 id="Variable_scope">Variable scope</h1> 
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code>if (true) {
                    var x = 5;
                  }
                  console.log(x);  // 5</code>
                  <code>if (true) {
                        let y = 5;
                      }
                      console.log(y);
                      // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <h1 id="Data_types">Data types</h1>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types</p>
            <code>if (condition) {
                    statement_1;
                  } else {
                    statement_2;
                  }</code>
         </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <h1 id="while_statement">while statement</h1>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
         </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <h1 id="Function_declarations">Function declarations</h1>
        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. </li>
            <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
